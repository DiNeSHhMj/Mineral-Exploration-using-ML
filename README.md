# Mineral-Exploration-using-ML
This code uses satellite images and machine learning to predict mineral deposits in a study area. The satellite images include gravity, magnetics, radiometrics, geology, distance to fault, and areas of interest. The images are loaded and combined into a single 1D array of features. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the features and the target variable, which is the areas of interest. The model is then used to predict mineral deposits in the study area, which are then visualized on top of the geology image using matplotlib. The code also includes feature engineering to create new features, such as the product of gravity and magnetics or radiometrics and geology. Overall, this code demonstrates how machine learning can be used with satellite imagery to make predictions about geological features.
